Before deploying our tool, we recomend you that you view our project outline to gain a general knowledge of our goals for this project with Zeek, Graylog, and Docker Compose. 

# SETUP (Do this order!): 
It is recomened that the you do set up this tool in the following order: 
1. Zeek - The network monitor to make sure that it is working. We had to use a lower version of zeek due to scaiblity issues that we have originally encountered.
2. Graylog - The application that will display all of the logs that are handed over from zeek to display onto graylog. Later on, dashboards can be set up for certain logs to be viewed.
3. Docker Compose - This is where all of the automation happens, using a docker compose will allow everything to be packaged and automated smoothly.
