# zeek
A scalable and flexible way to monitor a network. 

The main objective for our tool is the following: 
- Create a container that is able to contain network analysis components that would allow a machine to capture all of the logs produced on a given network.
- Be able to visualize the logs that were produced by the network logger, and create visual representation of the traffic on the network.
- At the end of the project, the goal is to have a minimum amount of configuration required for the end user during setup.
- Documentation to be provided for future use of the project.

The following is included in this github repository: 
- Zeek configuration script
- Keys File (See below for information)
- Zeek Configuration files
- Docker File
- Docker Compose File
- Documentation and research notes completed in the Winter of 2024

*Note\* It is NOT RECOMMENDED to keep the same keys as provided in the "keys" folder. You should make your own keys and replace the "known_hosts" folder with your own.
